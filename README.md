# Redis Self-Hosted with Docker

This repository provides a `docker compose` setup to run a self-hosted [Redis](https://redis.io/) instance.

It is configured to connect to a shared Docker network, allowing easy integration with other services like [n8n](https://github.com/AiratTop/n8n-self-hosted).

## Features

-   Uses the official Redis Docker image.
-   Data is persisted in a local volume.
-   Pre-configured for a shared network.
-   Includes scripts for easy management.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AiratTop/redis-self-hosted.git
    cd redis-self-hosted
    ```

2.  **Create the shared network:**
    If you haven't already, create the shared Docker network:
    ```bash
    docker network create shared_network
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Edit the `.env` file and set a secure password for `REDIS_PWD`.


4.  **Start the service:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Usage

-   **Start:** `docker compose up -d`
-   **Restart:** `./restart-docker.sh`
-   **Update:** `./update-docker.sh` (Pulls the latest Docker image and restarts)

## Connecting with n8n

This setup is designed to work with the [n8n-self-hosted](https://github.com/AiratTop/n8n-self-hosted) configuration. Since both services are on the `shared_network`, you can connect to Redis from n8n using `redis` as the host and `6379` as the port.
